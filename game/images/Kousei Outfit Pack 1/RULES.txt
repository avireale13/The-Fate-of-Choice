Q & A

Q:Can I use this in 18+ content?
A:Yes! Just please make sure that it doesn't positively promote things like pedophilia.

Q:Can I use this in a game jam or contest?
A:Yes! You have permission to use this in game jams or contests but it cannot be entered as a single piece (For example (but not limited to), you cannot enter any of the sprite into a character art contest because it is not yours.)

Q:Can I use this commercially?
A:For games, yes! It must still follow the rule that it cannot be sold alone. So it cannot be sold as an add-on for a visual novel engine for example. In short, if you make a game that uses it as a sprite but the user does not have to buy the sprite specifically to see it, that is fine!
By using the sprites commercially in your game, you are agreeing to let me know where the credit to my name is located if I ask.

Q:Does tipping/donating mean I get to use it without credit?
A:No! Giving credit to me is a very small act that I'm asking for from a large amount of work that I offer for free. Tips help me know that people like my work and go towards furthering my craft. Credit will ALWAYS be required.

Q:Can I use this for an NFT?
A:Absolutely not. DO NOT USE FOR/IN NFTS!!! It completely goes against several of my rules and my copyright is not abandoned.

Q:Can I use this for merchandise/a piece of art I'm selling?
A:In short, no.
Contact me on Twitter DMs (@noranekogames) to negotiate, but it will not be free to use for things like this.

Q:Can I use this for my school project?
A:If it is not being used commercially! Please make sure it follows everything mentioned above, though. It can't be the only thing your project consists of, for example, and I still require credit somewhere.

Q:Can I use this for a visual novel engine?
A:As long as it follows the rules in the Rules for Games section.

Are you making more outfits/CGs?
Very slowly but I am working on them!

Q:Can I modify the image?
A:It must still follow the rules even if the image is changed, but you can modify it! Changing the colors, drawing over it in a new style, adding characters, etc is absolutely fine.

Q:Can I use it on twitter?
A:Please find a way to credit me if you do!  Tag me @NoranekoGames and I will usually retweet it so you can get more exposure.

Q:Can I change the name?
A:Absolutely! Please feel free! My character sprites have names so that I can keep easier track of them for organization purposes.  A lot of people who aren't great at thinking up names choose to keep the name, so feel free to do that as well!

Q:Can I reupload this somewhere else?
A:As long as it is directly accompanied by credit to me and a link back to this page (not a direct link to the download.) It must be mentioned with the reupload that without following the rules posted on this page, it may be DMCA'd.
